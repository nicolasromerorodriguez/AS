## Expert system Analysis

Desicion tree.

The desicion tree presented takes into acount a few simple parameters. The firsto one asks if the person intends to watch the movie with teir family, this was set a the fisrst priority as the setting of a familiar movie is way different to the setting of watching a movie alone, as certain topics may be unconfortable in a social setting.

In case the movie was picked in a familiar setting the next question to ask was if they wanted to watch an animated movie, thintention of this question was to konw if the current setting was to watch a movie with kinds, in which case an animated movie would probably be the most preferable option.

For the other side of the tree there are 2 possible paths, if the user wanted to watch a documentary or not, this question was used as the mood to watch a documentary is very different from other types of movies. If the user doesn't want to watch a documentary then they would be redirected to other types of gebres that don't require an especific mindset as documentaries do.


This system is completely managed by if statements, as such the user doesn'nt have to enter many inputs, but it can break when the user soesn't register a valid entry.
