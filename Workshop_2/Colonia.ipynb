        "In this second workshop, the idea is you solve the _Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)_ using _Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)_ algorithm. It is time to apply a very popular swarm intelligence algorithm to a problem in the real world.\n",

        "Imagine you have been hired as __artificial intelligence engineer__ in an important logistic company. Your boss, a Chief Technology Officer, wants to get _shortest path_ to deliver some products. You analyze the problem, and figure out it is similar to _TSP_, and you remember you know some _swarm intellinge_ algoritms useful to solve this problem, in this case, _ACO_.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here you will have some tasks in order to complete this _workshop_:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create some diagrams and explanations to represent/understand the problem following a _systems thinking approach_.\n",
        "1. Generate several random $3D$ space points in order to define cities to be visited by the salesman.\n",
        "1. With random points, generate a list in order to define the requirements for the route.\n",
        "1. Implement ACO in order to solve TSP problem. Test different parameters combination.\n",
        "1. Draw a $3D$ plot in order to see the output of the algorithm.\n",
        "1. Think some conclusions based on outputs analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Write any technical concern/decision/difficulty  you think is relevant regarding your work. You must deliver a full report detailing each one of the previous steps. I strongly recommend you to use a _Jupyter Notebook_ or a _COLAB_ to write/execute your code. Also, your work must include the __report__, the __code__, and a __README.md__ file in repo of the course, everything in a folder called _workshop\\_2_."
